> Note that this extension is not made for scanning top-level folders, hence the term "simple".

## Settings

-   Path: the path to the folder in which you want to search for files and folders
-   Search for:
    -   Files and folders: select this option if you want to search for files and folders
    -   Files: select this option if you want to search for files only
    -   Folders: select this option if you want to search for folders only
-   Recursive: whether to do a recursive scan. Note that if you enable this option on a folder that contains a lot of files, you might experience poor performance or even brake the app.
